# Hacklahoma2021-Conscious-Driver
Hackathon Project

A device that prevents someone under the effects of alcohol to drive. The device combines the functionality of an alcoholmeter and a car anti robbery lock.  
This should be assemble before the person the gets out of the car, so that when they come back to the car there is now something that is stopping them from driving directly under that state. 
The device takes an alcoholmeter test, which determines the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and is represented by a percentage. If the person is above this limit (0.08%) the device will remain lock. This lock prevents them from moving the steering wheel and accelerator pedal. This way it stops the person from driving under that state.

Components:
- Arduino UNO
- Breadboard
- Sensor MQ-3
- Stepper Motor
- LEDs
